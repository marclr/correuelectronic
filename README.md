#Correu electronic
================
Application developed during the course 2013/2014 in the elective course of "Interf√≠cies d'usuari" (User interfaces), this application represents a email client (like gmail) designed to older people, for this app we only have the visual aspect.

In the develop of the app we have designed the high concept, the scenarios of use and the draft of the user interface, later, we have implemented the interface and checked that the different scenarios could be accomplished.

Also we have tried to facilitate the accessibility for people with visual problems adding the appropriate attributes for HTML elements.


The app has been developed using a single-page application with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application, the tools used are Backbone, Bootstrap, Jquery, Require and Underscore.

Attention: The app has been developed in Catalan, so the code and the interfaces will be in this language.
